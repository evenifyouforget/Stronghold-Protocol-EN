## 2. Content that does not belong to this project and is not covered by the GPL

All **names, characters, art, Spine models, UI images, music and sound effects, text and game data** related to *Arknights* and *Stronghold Protocol* are copyright of Shanghai Hypergryph Network Technology Co., Ltd. and its licensors (Yostar, etc.). Specifically this includes:

- `public/assets/**` in the full Release bundle (including the 3D board models and textures extracted locally from the official client, `public/assets/local/**`) and `public/fonts/**` (fonts belong to their respective authors);
- `data/*.json` generated from the official data tables, and `docs/research/*.json`, `test/fixtures/official-waves.json` and `public/dev/recordings/*.json`, which contain or are derived from game data;
- the game screenshots in `docs/img/`;
- text from community pages such as PRTS, BWIKI, NGA and Bahamut quoted in `docs/` (still under the license of their source; wiki text is CC BY-NC-SA).

This content is **not within the scope of the GPL-3.0 grant**, and this project has no right to grant anyone any rights to it.

## 3. Non-commercial use only

- This project is for **study, research and personal non-commercial entertainment** only.
- The rights holders of the game assets and data have not authorized this project or its users to make any commercial use of them. Therefore everything that contains or depends on these assets — the full Release bundle, servers you host, screenshots, recordings, live streams, etc. — **must not be used for profit in any form**. This includes but is not limited to:
  - selling or paid distribution;
  - charging for servers, paid rooms or memberships;
  - embedding ads;
  - tips, sponsorships or crowdfunding tied to this project;
  - packaging it into any paid product or service.
- When redistributing the full bundle, keep this notice, [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md), and likewise state that it is unofficial and non-commercial.
- The GPL itself permits commercial use of the **code**; the restrictions above apply to the game assets and data that do not belong to this project.

- The risks of using, hosting or publishing this project — including network security, third-party networking tools and services, and local laws and regulations — are borne by the user.
