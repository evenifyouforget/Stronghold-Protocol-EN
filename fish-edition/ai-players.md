# AI players: findings (2026-10-21)

Answers to the "Investigation/questions → AI players" list in TODO.md. Measured on main (0.2.5 + our PRs) with
`tools/botbench.mjs`, the repo's own bot benchmark: seeded bot-only matches with the real simulation in virtual time.

## What strategy do the AI players use? Is it optimized?

`server/match/bot.js` (~1,900 lines; summary in docs/META.md §1.5) is a hand-written heuristic player, not a learned
one. It sees only what a human would see, and acts through the same validated actions. Each prep:

1. **Economy:**
   - picks a focus core bond and a second bond;
   - buys toward a full board, completes merges, and levels the shop on a fixed curve (L2 ≈ R3 … L6 ≈ R12);
   - weighs each purchase against the expected value of refreshing for the third copy of a held pair.
2. **Lineup:** maximizes unit value plus bond tiers (greedy start, then swaps).
3. **Placement:**
   - traces the round's enemy routes over its board, and maximizes an "exposure" model (time on each tile × DPS
     against the round's DEF / RES, blocker hold time, anti-air for flyers);
   - then **rehearses**: it runs the 3 best layouts in the real battle simulation and keeps the one with the fewest
     leaks.
4. **Items and cards:**
   - items by role;
   - bounty cards by expected payout minus expected LP lost (its own kill-chance model).

It is optimized in the sense that each part was tuned against measurements: META.md says the planner beats random
layouts by ≈ 8 points of kill rate, and rehearsal adds ≈ 5 more. It is **unaware of our lobby rules**: it doesn't know
the SPA-CC tags exist, and it ignores Toxic Waste.

## How fast is its decision making?

Single-threaded (`--jobs 1`), HARD:

| | per bot prep, median / p95 |
|---|---|
| whole prep | 0.12 s / 0.22 s |
| decision logic only | 0.017 s / 0.05 s |
| layout rehearsal (3 simulated battles) | 0.10 s / 0.20 s |
| 机变 (card draft) pick | < 1 ms |

A co-op prep gives 65–215 s per round, and solo is untimed, so speed is no constraint. Rehearsal is the expensive part
and runs in 8 ms slices, so it never blocks the server.

## Is it competent? What is the win rate?

40 seeds per config (seeds 1–40), 4 bots in co-op:

| | Win | Reached the final boss | Losses: eliminated before the boss / lost the final fight |
|---|---|---|---|
| solo FUNNY | 50 % | 40 / 40 | 0 / 20 |
| solo NORMAL | 68 % | 40 / 40 | 0 / 13 |
| solo HARD | 25 % | 38 / 40 | 2 / 28 |
| solo ABYSS | 0 % | 22 / 40 | 18 / 22 |
| co-op ×4 FUNNY | 100 % | 40 / 40 | — |
| co-op ×4 NORMAL | 95 % | 40 / 40 | — |
| co-op ×4 HARD | 43 % | 35 / 40 | 5 / 18 |
| co-op ×4 ABYSS | 0 % | 9 / 40 | 31 / 9 |

**Reading:** it's a solid mid-level player. It almost always survives to the final boss on FUNNY–HARD; most losses
are the final fight, and ABYSS is out of reach. "Competent" is best defined against these numbers: a human who beats
the bot's win rate on the same difficulty plays better than the bot.

Things worth a look:
- **Solo FUNNY (50 %) is harder for the bot than solo NORMAL (68 %).** FUNNY's final boss comes at round 9, against a
  board at shop level 4. Every loss is the final fight with LP left. Either the easiest mode's boss is too strong for
  a round-9 board, or the bot doesn't plan for an early boss.
- **The boss drawn matters most.** Across the solo runs:
  - 阿利斯泰尔，帝国余晖 (`boss_6`, Alistair) was never beaten except twice on NORMAL;
  - 假想敌：胄 (`boss_1`) went 6/6 on FUNNY;
  - 卢西恩 (`boss_5`, Lucien) won about half its fights on FUNNY, NORMAL and HARD.
  The samples are small (3–12 per boss and difficulty).
- **Its bounty estimate is pessimistic.** Cards it rated 0–20 % likely to beat were beaten 54 % of the time, and
  20–50 % ones 88 % of the time. It turns down bounties it would have won, so there's room to tune.
- **A simulation bug found on the way:** in co-op NORMAL seed 22, Bubble (泡泡, `chess_char_2_08`, her S2 counter on any
  enemy damage) and 碎铳之簧 (`enemy_9018_actrpa`, a boss part that passes damage on) trigger each other until the
  32-deep hook guard cuts it off: 64 errors in one battle. Repro:
  `node tools/matchrun.mjs --mode coop --difficulty NORMAL --players 4 --seed 22 --rehearsal 3 --errors`.
  It's probably upstream too; the likely fix is that a counter doesn't answer damage that is itself a pass-on, or the
  other way round.

## Can we run many AI matches in the background to gather data?

Yes, and it's cheap: a solo match takes ≈ 2–4 s and a 4-bot co-op match ≈ 8 s of one CPU core. `botbench` runs N worker
threads (`--jobs`), and the matches are seeded, so the results are reproducible. The 320 matches above took ~9 minutes
on 8 threads. The tag sweep below (800 matches) took about 70 minutes on 8 threads. That's slower per match than the
grid: NORMAL matches run the full 14 rounds, and the boss tags make the battles longer.

## Can we map the SPA-CC difficulty curve with it?

Yes, with the caveat that the bot plays tag-unaware. It measures what a tag costs a player who doesn't adapt to it.
I added `--rules key=level,…` to `tools/botbench.mjs` (it passes them into the match as lobby rules) and ran every
tag at level 1 (Risk 1 each) on solo NORMAL, on the same 40 seeds as the baseline:

| Tag (level 1, Risk 1) | Win (baseline 68 %) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| ccLockout | 0 % | −68 |
| ccPatriot | 10 % | −58 |
| ccDelegation | 30 % | −38 |
| ccLeaderDr | 33 % | −35 |
| ccBoss | 40 % | −28 |
| ccFamiglia | 40 % | −28 (and LP left 9.0 vs 21.8) |
| ccTier1Price | 43 % | −25 |
| ccLowEfficiency | 48 % | −20 |
| ccOzArts | 58 % | −10 |
| ccJunk | 60 % | −8 |
| ccOzPhys | 60 % | −8 |
| ccSpRecovery, ccDeepInfiltration, ccVengeance | 63 % | −5 |
| ccInvestorBench, ccSwift, ccUpgrade, ccLastLine | 68 % | 0 |
| ccStrategyLate | 70 % | +2 |
| ccForesight | 73 % | +5 |

- With 40 seeds, a change of ±5 points (2 wins) is noise.
- **Every one of these is Risk 1, yet the costs range from nothing to everything.** If Risk should reflect difficulty,
  Lockout, Patriot, Delegation and Leader DR are underpriced at Risk 1, and the ones at 0 are overpriced.
- **The zero-cost tags** are probably tags the bot ignores or that don't apply solo: Swift (prep time; solo is untimed),
  Investor Bench, Upgrade, Strategy Late. Last Line costs LP (LP left 18.5 vs 21.8) but not wins. Humans may feel
  these more than the bot does.
- **Next steps if wanted:**
  - higher levels, and combinations;
  - co-op;
  - more seeds for the close calls;
  - a Risk vs win-rate chart.
  The command for one tag:
  `node tools/botbench.mjs --configs solo:NORMAL --seeds 40 --jobs 8 --rules ccPatriot=1 --json patriot.json`.

## Data from real matches (records, stats, privacy)

**Nothing is collected today.** The server keeps no record of a finished match. Results go only to the players'
screens (and stay a few minutes for a reconnecting player). The client's "Report a problem" text is only made when a
player asks for it.

**What could be collected:** botbench's per-match record is already the right shape, and could be reused for real
matches (an opt-in server option, off by default):
- version and content hash, mode, difficulty, lobby rules, plugins, seed;
- per seat: human or bot, band, rounds passed;
- per round and seat: LP, shop level, board value, units, bonds and tiers, layers, elites, items, leaks, bounty picks;
- the result and titles.

That's enough for win rates by difficulty, tag and band; humans vs bots; and the stack counts / layers you mentioned.

**Your format suggestion fits well:** one small JSON file per match, in a folder per day. Any subset of files is then a
valid data set, an admin can zip a folder and send it, and a tool (`tools/records.mjs`, like botbench's `--compare`) can
scan a folder and print the same tables as above.

**Optional, later:** the matches are seeded, battles take no player input, and the bots are deterministic. So the seed
plus the ordered list of prep actions should be enough to replay a whole match. That needs checking before relying on
it, since in co-op the order of actions between seats matters.

**What not to collect:**
- player names, IP addresses, session or reconnect tokens, room codes;
- browser or device details;
- exact timestamps (the date is enough);
- emotes or any other chat-like activity;
- the "Report a problem" text.

Seats should be "seat 0–3, human / bot", with no identity that links one match to the next, unless players opt in.

**How much better do humans play?** Unknown until there's real-match data. Once records exist, compare human win
rate and rounds passed per difficulty against the bot's table above.

## First human records (`logs/2026-10-21.7z`, 2026-10-21)

Six records from one server, read with `tools/records.mjs` (branch `wip/match-records`, #42).

**Did the logging work?** Yes.
- All six files parse.
- **All 47 recorded normal battles replay to exactly the recorded result** (`--verify`). That's from human play, not bots.
- Every human action is there, and no field anywhere holds a name or id.

Three gaps showed up, now fixed on #42:
- **The last round had no row.** A final boss or hidden round ends without a SETTLE.
- **A match abandoned during the drafts counted as a loss** in the tables. Now it's counted apart.
- **The file times dated each match to the second** (13:25 … 15:14), and the 7z kept them. Now they're set to the day's
  midnight UTC.

**The matches** (all solo, all human):

| Mode | Rules | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FUNNY ×3 | none | 3 wins, 0–2 LP lost | L5 by round 6–7, board value 24–30 at the boss, 7–8 perfect rounds each |
| NORMAL | Risk 7 + cheats (tier start, booster pack, Virtuosa bonds, Blaze) | win, hidden cleared, 0 leaks | 8 elites, 9 bonds; 201 refreshes, 183 rewards |
| ABYSS | Risk 34: every tag and cheat on | lost in round 10 | leaked from round 1 (4 of 8 enemies), 50 leaks in all |
| FUNNY | Risk 7 + cheats | abandoned during the drafts | no battle |

**What we can say (6 matches is a small sample):**
- **Humans won solo FUNNY 3 of 3; the bot wins it 50 %.** The bot loses its FUNNY matches at the round-9 boss.
  The humans reached it at shop level 5, with a board value of 24–30.
- **Human prep on FUNNY:** about 21 buys, 10–17 refreshes and 1–3 merges over 9 rounds. About 2 buys a round and
  more refreshes than buys.
- **The cheat runs are dominated by the booster pack:**
  - 432 and 572 actions in round 1 alone;
  - about 200 equips (each one opens the pack's offer);
  - about 200 picks, 150–160 sells and 200 refreshes per match.

  The records are fine for this, but per-round averages mix these runs with normal play. Filter by rule when
  analysing.
- **SPA-CC:** the one Risk 34 run says only that everything at once is too much at ABYSS. Mapping tag costs needs many
  matches per tag, or the botbench sweep above.

## Why do humans win Standard (FUNNY) and the bot doesn't? (2026-10-22)

Fish's question: humans don't seem to lose on Standard Simulation (FUNNY), so what is the bot doing differently?

The data:
- the bot on solo FUNNY, current `main` (0.3.1): 160 seeds (1–160), 82 wins (51 %);
- the three human FUNNY records with no cheats or tags (above): 3 wins. Those records end at round 8, before the last-round fix.

| at round 8 | bot | humans |
|---|---|---|
| shop level (round 6 / 8) | 4.0 / 4.0 | 4.7 / 5.0 |
| board value | 29 | 26 |
| elites deployed | 1.2 | 0.3 |
| Σ bond tiers | 4.6–5.3 | 3.7 |
| units by tier T1–T6, round 6 | 2.5 2.0 2.9 **0.5** 0.1 0 | 2.7 1.3 1.3 **2.7** 0 0 |
| units by tier T1–T6, round 8 | 1.6 1.2 2.7 1.6 0.9 **0** | 1.7 1.0 1.3 2.3 1.0 **0.7** |

**The difference:** the humans level the shop early and field high-tier operators: tier 4 by round 6, tier 5–6 by round 8.
- They do it at the cost of bonds and merges: lower board value, fewer elites, fewer bond tiers.
- The bot spends on bonds and on merging low-tier units. It never fields a tier-6 unit on FUNNY.
- Its won and lost boards look the same, so the boss drawn decides its result.

**The cause:** the bot's level curve ignores the mode's length. `server/match/bot.js` `LEVEL_TARGET` is indexed by the round:
- it aims for L4 from round 7 through 9, and L5 at round 10;
- it was tuned for the 14-round modes;
- FUNNY's final boss is round 9, so the bot meets it with a shop level-4 board.

**Tested:** a scratch change, not committed, scaled the curve by the boss round: `idx = round(r × 14 / bossRound)`. NORMAL and the other 14-round modes are unchanged by construction.

| solo FUNNY | seeds 1–40 | seeds 41–160 | all 160 |
|---|---|---|---|
| current curve | 58 % | 49 % | 51 % |
| curve scaled by the boss round | 70 % | 63 % | 65 % |

A shift of only 2 rounds gave 63 % on seeds 1–40. The scaled curve overshoots: the bot reaches L6 at round 9, where the humans were at L5. So a tuned curve may do better still.

**By boss** (160 seeds, wins/losses, current → scaled):

| boss | current | scaled |
|---|---|---|
| 假想敌：胄 (boss_1) | 23/1 | 20/4 |
| 假想敌：铳 (boss_2) | 8/19 | 13/14 |
| 假想敌：管 (boss_3) | 13/7 | 19/1 |
| 昆图斯 (boss_4) | 12/2 | 12/2 |
| 卢西恩 (boss_5) | 20/17 | 26/11 |
| 阿利斯泰尔 (boss_6) | 5/18 | 6/17 |
| 萨米的意志 (boss_7) | 1/14 | 8/7 |

**Alistair stays out of reach for the bot even with the better curve.** One human beat him on FUNNY, with Lumen (T6), Record Keeper (T5), and Hoshiguma and Sankta Miksaparato (both T4) at shop level 5. The leveling fix doesn't explain the rest: the bot's lineup or placement against him needs its own look. One human win is too few to say what works.

The other humans faced 卢西恩 (boss_5) and 昆图斯 (boss_4).

**Caveats:**
- three human matches;
- the bot plays one band at random, while the humans chose theirs.

**Possible follow-ups:**
- a PR making `LEVEL_TARGET` follow `gd.bossRound` (gameplay-neutral, bots only; probably upstream-friendly);
- then tune the curve itself, maybe L5 at round 7–8 for FUNNY;
- an Alistair study: boards and leaks per bot loss.

## The first human match records (logs/2026-10-21.7z, analysed 2026-10-22)

Six `SP_RECORDS` files, all from app 0.3.1, all solo. One was abandoned before its first battle, so `tools/records.mjs` counts five:

| match | rules | result | LP at the end |
|---|---|---|---|
| FUNNY ×3 | no lobby rules, Risk 0 | 3 wins, 9 rounds each | 23, 23 and 29 |
| NORMAL | Tier Start, Booster Pack, Blaze, Virtuosa bonds, Risk 7 with cheats | win, Hidden Core cleared | 25 of 25, every battle perfect |
| ABYSS | 19 Risk tags (Risk 34), Double LP, Extra Deploy, Extra Funds | eliminated in round 10 | 0 |

**Did the logging work? Yes.**
- `node tools/records.mjs --verify` replayed every normal battle from its recorded BattleSpec: **47 same, 0 differ**; 5 skipped (boss / hidden / synthetic).
- Every file parsed, and seats, bands, lobby rules, actions and per-battle kills are all there.

**Gaps and oddities in the data:**
- **No row for a won match's last rounds.** `rec.rounds` is pushed from `m.settle` (server/match/records.js), and a match that ends in victory never settles its final round(s): the FUNNY wins have 8 rows for 9 rounds, the NORMAL win 13 for 15 (no Final Assault, no Hidden Core row). The ABYSS loss has all 10. The battles themselves are recorded. Fix: push a last row when the match finishes.
- **Kills above the total:** in ABYSS round 8 the seat killed 64 of 29 and in round 9 47 of 30. With ccFamiglia=5 / ccPatriot=3 / ccDelegation=3 on, probably the Risk tags' spawned enemies counting in `killed` but not in `total`. Not traced.
- **A frozen ABYSS board:** level 5, 10 deployed and a board value of 111 in every row, though the seat bought, equipped and levelled. Either a Risk tag (ccLockout=3, ccUpgrade=2?) blocks it, or the purchases stayed on the bench, which the row doesn't count. Not traced.
- **Round-1 churn is the Booster Pack, not investors:** the two Booster Pack matches opened with 120–160 rewards / equips and 83–125 sells in round 1. That's why the per-round table shows 41.6 sells per seat in round 1. Read that table per rule, not pooled.

**What we learn:**
- Humans won FUNNY 3 of 3 at Risk 0. The bot wins about 51 % (65 % with the bossRound-scaled level curve above), so this agrees with the earlier finding. But it's three games.
- Tier Start + Booster Pack + cheats make NORMAL trivial. The NORMAL board was already 8 elites at level 6 after round 1, it never changed, and it lost no LP all match, including Final Assault and Hidden Core. From round 11 the seat only rolled the shop.
- Stacking 19 Risk tags at ABYSS was steadily lost: 4–12 leaks every round from round 1, LP 52 → 0 by round 10, even with Double LP. One data point for the SPA-CC difficulty curve.
- Five matches by what looks like one or two players is too few for win rates. Next time it's worth recording co-op and a spread of single Risk tags.
