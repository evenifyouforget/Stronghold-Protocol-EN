## Notes on Degenbrecher and Zaaro (2026-10-15)

Both have their second form and their revive in the sim (`server/sim/content/enemies/leaders.js`; the revive is the
shared `reborn()` of `enemies/archetypes.js`): the first knock-out is hidden, the enemy stays put invulnerable and
untargetable while its HP refills, then it stands up in its second form and is invincible for a while. The numbers come
from the official data.

**Zaaro, Signore dei Lupi** (`enemy_1535_wlfmster`)
- Revive: **40 s** (`Reborn.duration` 40), with Primal Deterrence slowing the units around him meanwhile; then 10 s
  invincible (`Passive2.invincible_time`). So yes, 40 s as in the original.
- First form: −30 % damage taken, can't be stunned, Hemolytic Horror (3 operators: ASPD −70, can't retreat, a bleed
  that ramps over 40 s, cured once he loses 20 % HP).
- Second form: ranged double hits, more ATK, longer Hemolytic Horror, Primal Deterrence still on.
- Not modelled: **Blood Debt** and **Furious Howl** (both feed the event's Blood Debt gauge, which this mode lacks).

**Degenbrecher** (`enemy_1525_blkswb`)
- Revive: **5 s** (`Reborn.duration` 5), then 10 s invincible (`Reborn.invincible` 10).
- First form: Status Resistance, DEF penetration against his blocker, Quickslay (blinks through his blocker, hitting
  everyone on the way), Raging Blizzard (AoE).
- Second form: stealth, more DEF penetration (40 %), double hits, and at every 25 % HP lost a burst that clears the SP
  of the operators around him and disarms them.
- **Gap**: his second form's ATK +50 % (`AtkUp.enemy_blkswb_t_1[reborn].atk` 0.5) is in the data but not applied by the
  kit — worth fixing before using him in a Risk tag.
- Not modelled: **Snowfall** (降雪, an event stage mechanic).

**How strong they get.** Leaders in regular rounds scale with the round's enemy multipliers, not the final boss's pool:
on Ultimate, round 13, co-op ×6.69 HP and ×1.95 ATK (Zaaro ≈ 234,000 HP, Degenbrecher ≈ 187,000), solo ×2.99 HP and
×1.77 ATK. The final bosses fight from a pool of millions (3–4.2 M on Ultimate). So against a late-game SPA board both
would fall fast unless a tag scales them up — the same lever as `ccBoss`, applied to a chosen leader.
