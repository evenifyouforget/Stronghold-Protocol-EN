# Phase 1 - Understanding

Hi Claude. You can call me Fish. This game (Stronghold Protocol Alliance) has passed through some different hands, until it ended up open source. I felt the original had some missed opportunities, so I forked the repo so I could mod it myself.

I'm opting to try an AI-first workflow - meaning I'll manually code if needed, but I always offer you the first attempt at any task. Don't delete this remove-before-merge/ directory - that is the human's responsibility to do manually.

See TODO.md

For branding purposes, this fork is Fish Edition, because I am Fish.

# Phase 2 - Scoping

Assess the feasibility of ideas in Appendix A - Ideas, and decide what the next PR should be.

Priority factors in:

- Hard dependencies
- Soft dependencies (one feature acts as a prototype or gives useful insights for another)
- Ease of implementation
- Possibility of parallel independent PRs
- User demand/urgency

# Phase 3 - Implementation

# Appendix A - Ideas

## Menu/UI

- Highlighted keywords (ex. Cold) already exist, but they don't currently show a definition on hover or on click. On click to show a popup with the keyword definition would be helpful.
- Some kind of damage chart (possibly hidden in a post-game analysis tab) would be helpful. The simplest prototype would be a bar chart that splits by operator (so duplicates of the same operator end up counting toward the same bar). A probably more useful chart would split by operator/player/round, with 3 buttons to toggle whether operator/player/round are combined, and an additional 2 buttons to filter round to only last round/second last round (since these are the boss rounds and it would be a very common query).
- On the difficulty selection screen, it doesn't show details for what each difficulty actually changes. Like, is this giving enemies +50% HP? If Ultimate is just adding a flat stat modifier, that sounds simple enough to just change the text to say. If it's a long list of changes, we might be able to hide it in a help menu.
- Status effects that currently show as an icon above enemies' heads, don't show how long it lasts (for effects that expire). Considering these are already circular icons, it seems simple enough to make an arc chart in the form of a thick outline.
- Status effects that currently show as an icon above enemies' heads, some of these have an associated stack or variable, but it's not visible. (correct me if I'm wrong but) Fragile is one of these, and currently there's no way to distinguish 35% Fragile from 40% Fragile.

## Gameplay Expansion

All of these will require some input from the dev before the details are finalized.

- A difficulty higher than Ultimate.
- Gameplay modifiers which the host of the lobby (for simplicity, we can ignore matchmaking for this and only consider solo or custom lobbies) can choose to enable for the whole lobby. (a) +2 Deployment Limit (b) +2 Funds every round (c) Doubled enemy waves (the enemy list is copied once) (d) Disable time limit for all user action screens (but not the autobattle timer) (e) Enable rebalanced Alliance effects.
- Alliance Modules. Like how Operator Modules give a choice of different gameplay for each Operator, Alliance Modules give a choice of different gameplay for an Alliance. Not all Alliances will have Module selections, so it is an optional field. For matchmaking, all Alliance Modules are locked to Mod A (the original effect). For solo/custom lobbies, the host of the lobby can select the Modules for all Alliances, and this is shared between all players. (it must be this way because the final boss combines 2 players' boards, and if we allowed per-user selections, there may be a conflict in the combined board)
- Custom Operator Modules. In the original game, releasing new Modules are the preferred way to buff old Operators that don't really hold up to modern standards anymore, rather than buffing the Operator directly. These custom Modules would be banned for matchmaking (rather than lockout, it's probably easier on the fly to detect the custom module and instead swap loadout to the first available module, or remove the module if there are no non-custom modules available. this way we fail gracefully) and allowed in solo/custom lobbies.
- "Rebalanced Alliance Effects" - see below section
- For solo/custom lobbies only - ability to directly choose the Alliance bans and map. If you don't choose it, it will be random like usual.

### Alliance Modules

#### Laterano Mod B

[Laterano] Operators gain +min(5 + 1.0 × stacks, 75 + 0.3 × stacks)% ammo on skill activation

<At 100 stacks> [Laterano] Operators deal 200% damage. "On spending X bullets" effects (namely, Mostima, Executor the Ex Foedere, Lemuen) trigger twice.

<With 6 different [Laterano] Operators on field> All [Laterano] Operators +4% ATK whenever any [Laterano] Operator spends 1 ammo, max +200%

##### Analysis

Mod B is less bullets until 100 stacks, at which point it jumps to effectively more bullets than Mod A, and Mod A wins again at 272 stacks.

Mod B solves one of Laterano lategame's biggest problem, which is that Lemuen skill 3 only shoots all at once after expending all bullets, and it takes too long for her to shoot. Limiting the amount of bullets means she doesn't take ages to shoot, while the 200% damage modifier compensates.

Local pro player pointed out the real reason Mod B will likely be preferred, is purely for the midgame Executor the Ex Foedere farming of Foresight (one of the 3 economy Alliances) Alliance stacks, which will now be accumulated twice as fast. You don't even need to stay on Laterano for late game. Just get 100 Laterano stacks, get your gold, and then buy the thing you actually want.

#### Victoria Mod B

- Rejected after pro player review (doesn't solve what makes Victoria weak, which is poor stabilization)

[Victoria] Operators carrying equipment deal (125 + 0.8 × stacks)% damage

<Every 100 stacks> Obtain a random special Victorian Hammer

<At 300 stacks> Gain one Damazti Isomorph (once only). When entering Rest Phase, convert excess stacks above 300 to next most stacked active Alliance.

<With 6 different [Victoria] Operators on field> All [Victoria] Operators gain +50% ATK for each piece of equipment; or +80% ATK if equipment is upgraded*

#### Victoria Mod C

- Suggested by our local pro player

Victoria operators gain +8 SP after skill activation per Victorian Hammer equipped. Victorian Hammers in the shop cost 0 and are upgraded. At the end of Rest Phase, Victoria operators with a Victorian Hammer equipped gain Victoria stacks equal to their tier.

At 6 Victoria operators, Victoria operatiors with Victorian Hammers equipped gain stacks to all of their non-Victoria active alliances equal to double their tier. At the start of combat, Victoria operators gain (200 + 1.2x stacks)% ATK, 200% HP as Barrier, and Status Resistance.

#### Kjerag Mod B

- Rejected after pro player review (Kjerag is already strong, why are you making it stronger)

[Kjerag] Operators deal 125% damage, or (135 + 1 × stacks)% damage to Cold and Frozen enemies

<With 6 different [Kjerag] Operators on field> [Kjerag] Operators deal 10% ATK as Necrosis injury, or 100% ATK as Arts damage to enemies already under Necrosis burst. Both the added Necrosis injury and added Arts damage are doubled against enemies immune to Freeze.

#### Siracusa Mod B

- Rejected after pro player review (Siracusa is already strong, why are you making it stronger)

[Siracusa] Operators gain +(5 + 0.2 × stacks) initial SP and +(25 + 0.8 × stacks) ASPD while skill is active

<With 6 different [Siracusa] Operators on field> [Siracusa] Operators also gain Invisibility while skill is active, and deal (10000 + 100 × stacks) True damage to enemies in a radius of 1.5 on skill end or death.

### Rebalanced Alliance Effects

I'll bundle others into this category if they don't fit as an Alliance Mod B or an Operator Mod Z.

- Give Virtuosa membership in Swift and Aid in addition to Laterano. (because Virtuosa is currently very weak)
- Give Civilight Eterna, Mlynar, Nearl the Radiant Knight, Vina Victoria, and Lappland the Decadenza membership in a new "Radiant" Alliance focused on buffing True damage. (since currently Arts damage gets the most love, followed by Physical damage and the Elemental damage types, and True damage doesn't have many buff sources)
- Catherine is replaced entirely with Blaze (who inherits Catherine's skill selection). Blaze is a member of Yan and Victoria, and her passive is changed to <When sold> Produces Blaze the Igniting Spark. (just like in season 1)

#### Radiant

*Add-on Alliance · ??? · activates at 2*

Enemies take +(10 + 1 × stacks)% True damage.
